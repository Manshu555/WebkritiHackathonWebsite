### - Backend Features:

Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the backend features of your website, highlighting MongoDB and EmailJS:

### Backend Overview

1. **Database Management with MongoDB:**

   - **NoSQL Database:** MongoDB is used as the database management system, storing user data, registration details, and hackathon information in a flexible, document-oriented format.
   - **Scalability:** The choice of MongoDB allows for easy scaling as the number of participants and events grows, ensuring the website can handle large amounts of data efficiently.
   - **Data Retrieval:** The database enables quick retrieval and manipulation of data, such as fetching user profiles, hackathon details, and participation records, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
   - **Security:** MongoDB incorporates authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data, such as user credentials and registration information.

2. **Email Notifications with EmailJS:**
   - **Automated Emails:** EmailJS is integrated to handle the sending of automated emails upon form submissions, such as confirming participation in a hackathon.
   - **Real-time Communication:** Participants receive real-time email notifications, ensuring they are promptly informed about their registration status and any important updates.
   - **Customization:** Emails sent through EmailJS can be customized to include event-specific information, personalized messages, and branding, enhancing the overall user experience.
   - **Integration with Forms:** When a participant submits the Participation Form, EmailJS triggers an email to both the participant and the event organizers, confirming the successful registration and providing necessary details.

These backend components work together to provide a reliable, secure, and user-friendly experience for everyone involved in the IIITM hackathons.
